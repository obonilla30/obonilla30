I am for ever thankful to all the engineers, programmers, and other collaborators creating tools and solutions that have helped my company move forward. I always have been very interested in coding but never had the opportinity to take a class on it. I am 42 now and time is very limited. I am still interested. I want to contribute to the community with a monetary contribution as an expression of gratitude. 
I do not know to whom or where I should send. I have self thought to build personal, workstations and servers without any prior knowledge which I find very simple yet I lack the knowledge of 
coding to create apps to create effociency for my staff. My services are through microsoft. The cost is very expensive. If anyone reading this profile. I would like to hire your services to teach me key point knowledge
feel free to contact me.
